# Project Facebook Clone #5

JavaScript is a very popular and versatile programming language that is widely used in web development. It supports a wide range of platforms and devices, and is a good choice for projects involving data manipulation and user interaction.

This project was developed in 3 and a half hours, thanks to a tutorial on YouTube, content creator and FullStack programmer, JavaScript Mastery thanks to him I was able to make this great project called Real State, I hope it will be useful for future projects, or so you can improve your knowledge of this project!
